- **Developed in Java and JavaFX.**
- **Assumes ideal conditions and standard gravity on Earth at sea level.**
- **Ignores Aerodynamic Drag since the ICBM spends most of its time in the Midcourse Phase, which is outside the Earth's Atmosphere.**
- **Ignores gravity at different altitudes and points on Earth and considers only the standard gravity.**
- **Performs projectile calculations and projects the Realtime Movements on a Rectangular Map with the help of Mercator Projection.**
- **Even with above assumptions, it provides calculations with upto 80% accuracy.**
